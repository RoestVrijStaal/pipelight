# In order to support browsers without NPAPI timer support
# (like Midori) we've implemented a fallback to
# NPN_PluginThreadAsyncCall. In the default configuration 
# a timer based approach is preffered over async calls and the
# plugin decides by itself which method to use depending on the
# browser capabilities. Setting the following option to true
# forces the plugin to use async calls. This might be mainly
# useful for testing the difference between both event handling
# approaches.

# Silverlight uses a lot of timer stuff do to the window redrawing
# . In order to speed this up a bit the following switch enables
# some API hooks to do most of timer stuff in user mode (without
# having to call wine-server each time). It is still unclear
# if this option has any significant effent on the performance.
