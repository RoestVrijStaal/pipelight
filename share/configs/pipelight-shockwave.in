# multiple versions of the Shockwave plugin installed inside the Wineprefix.

# HKLM\Software\MozillaPlugins\ where to search for the plugin path.

# You should use this option instead of dllPath/dllName in most cases
# since you do not need to alter dllPath on a Shockwave update.

# fakeVersion allows to fake the version string of Shockwave
# We don't know any reason why it would be necessary for Shockwave
#
# fakeVersion       = 12.0.4.144

#
# overwriteArg allows to overwrite/add initialization arguments
# passed by websites to Shockwave applications. You can
# use this option as often as you want to overwrite multiple
# parameters. Shockwave encapsulates most shockwave parameters into
# the swremote parameter. It is therefore only possible to overwrite
# all of the swremote subkeys or none.
#
# The subkeys which we found are:
# swSaveEnabled
# swVolume
# swRestart
# swPausePlay
# swFastForward
# swContextMenu
#
# Some more information about this topic are available at
# http://www.director-online.com/buildArticle.php?id=357
#
# Example:
# overwriteArg = swremote="swSaveEnabled='true' swVolume='true' swRestart='true' swPausePlay='true' swFastForward='true' swContextMenu='true'"

#
# Path to the dependency installer script provided by the compholio
# package. (optional)
#

#
# Dependencies which should be installed for this plugin via the
# dependencyInstaller, can be used multiple times. (optional)
#
# Useful values for Shockwave are:
#   wine-Shockwave-installer
