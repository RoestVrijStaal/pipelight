This directory contains the current WORK-IN-PROGRESS versions of wine patches.
As they might be still contain untested code we recommend to use the tested
versions instead, especially when providing a package for multiple users!

Take a look at the /wine-patches/ directory and use for example the provided
downloader script to grab them automatically.
