pipelight (0.1-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Fixed build flags for wingw32. (fixes launchpad issue 1213725)

  * Added undocumented option gccruntimedlls to the config file.

  * Added experimental usermode timer support.
  	(can be enabled via config file: experimental-usermodetimer)

  * Added an alternative event handling method using async calls
  	to make it work with browsers like Midori which don't support timers.

  * Fixed the wine xembed patch such that it also should work on KDE
    and probably other window mangers / desktop environments.
    (hopefully fixes launchpad issue 1213784)

  * Added support for a PIPELIGHT_CONFIG environment variable to overwrite
    the config search path.

  * Merged with changes by Joseph Yasi (merge 180968)
    Allows to define WINEARCH via the config.

  * Added fix to make Pipelight working with Opera (fixes launchpad issue 1214447)

  * Added the possibility to enable/disable Wine system-wide

  * Changed meaning of winePath variable in config file - its now the path to
    the wine directory, not the wine executable (see default config)

  * Prevent Wine from asking for Gecko or Mono
