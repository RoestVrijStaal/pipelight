.SH NAME
Pipelight \- use Windows plugins in Linux browsers (based on Wine)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pipelight-plugin
[\fIOPTIONS \fR...] \fICOMMAND\fR
.PP
For a list of possible options and commands please take a look at the
\fBOPTIONS/COMMANDS\fR section on the man page.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pipelight is a special browser plugin which allows one to use Windows only
plugins inside Linux browsers. Currently supported plugins are Silverlight,
Flash, Shockwave, the Unity3D Webplayer, and some more (see the \fBPLUGINS\fR
section).
.PP
The commandline utility \fBpipelight-plugin\fR allows you to enable/disable
plugins and to update the plugin database.
.SH OPTIONS/COMMANDS
.SS "Options:"
.TP
\fB\-y, \-\-accept\fR
Don't ask the user for license confirmation, instead enable plugins directly.
Can be used to automate the process of accepting the license agreement.
.SS "User commands:"
.TP
\fB\-\-enable\fR \fIPLUGIN\fR
Enables the specified plugin for the current user (by creating a symlink in
\fI$HOME/.mozilla/plugins\fR). When you run this command as root the plugin is
enabled system-wide by creating a symlink in the mozilla plugins directory
instead (often located at \fI/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins\fR). For a list of
plugins see the \fBPLUGINS\fR section in this man page.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\fR \fIPLUGIN\fR
Disables the specified plugin for the current user, or disables the system-wide
symlink when executed as root. Please note that a plugin may still stay
active if it was enabled both system-wide and for the current user before.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-all\fR
Disables all enabled plugins. For more details see \fB--disable\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-enabled\fR
Returns a list of all plugins which are enabled for the current user. The
result contains one plugin per line in order to simplify parsing by external
scripts.
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-enabled\-all\fR
Returns a list which contains both the plugins enabled for the current user and
additionally the system-wide enabled plugins. If a plugin is enabled multiple
times it also appears multiple times in the list.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Shows a short version of this help.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Shows the current version of Pipelight.
.SS "Global commands (require root rights):"
.TP
\fB\-\-create\-mozilla\-plugins\fR
In order to make it possible to use multiple Windows plugins with Pipelight at
the same time, it is necessary to have multiple copies of \fIlibpipelight.so\fR
installed. This command is typically used in the installation process of Pipelight
itself to create all the necessary copies. On a first execution it will only create
the libraries for the standard plugins, on all future executions it will
additionally update all unlocked additional plugins.
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\-mozilla\-plugins\fR
Removes all the copies of \fIlibpipelight.so\fR. This command is typically
used during the uninstallation (but not for updating!). All unlocked plugins
are locked again afterwards.
.TP
\fB\-\-unlock\fR PLUGIN
To save some disk space the default installation of Pipelight only creates
copies of \fIlibpipelight.so\fR for the most commonly used plugins. This
command can be used to unlock an additional plugin by creating another copy of
\fIlibpipelight.so\fR. Afterwards you can \fB--enable\fR it like any other
standard plugin.
.TP
\fB\-\-lock\fR PLUGIN
Removes the copy of \fIlibpipelight.so\fR for a specific plugin. This command
can only be used for additional plugins, not for the standard plugins.
.TP
\fB\-\-update\fR
Establishes a connection to the Pipelight upstream repository and downloads
the latest version of the plugin database (called \fIdependency-installer\fR)
containing the plugin URLs and checksums. The main purpose of this command is
to update the plugins between the official Pipelight releases. The signature
of the downloaded file is checked to prevent corruption or modification.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
You can export the following environment variables to modify the behaviour of
\fBpipelight-plugin\fR.
.TP
\fBMOZ_PLUGIN_PATH\fR
Create the plugin symlinks in the provided path instead of
\fI$HOME/.mozilla/plugins\fR. You can use this environment variable to keep
your Pipelight plugins separate from your other browser plugins.
.SH PLUGINS
Pipelight currently supports the following browser plugins:
.TP
\fBStandard plugins\fR
silverlight5.1,
silverlight5.0,
silverlight4,
flash,
unity3d,
widevine
.TP
\fBAdditional plugins (experimental or not often used):\fR
shockwave,
foxitpdf,
grandstream,
adobereader,
hikvision,
npactivex,
roblox
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Here are some typical examples how to use \fBpipelight-plugin\fR.
.PP
$ sudo pipelight-plugin --update
.PP
Downloads the latest version of the plugin database. If there was a new
update, it will be installed on the next browser restart or when the plugin is
reloaded the next time.
.PP
$ sudo pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight --enable unity3d
.PP
Enable multiple plugins (in this example Silverlight and the Unity3D Webplayer)
system-wide.
.PP
$ MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/myplugins pipelight-plugin --enable silverlight
.br
$ MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/myplugins/ google-chrome --user-data-dir=$HOME/.config/chrome-pipelight
.PP
The first line enables Silverlight in the (self-defined) plugin directory
\fI$HOME/myplugins\fR, afterwards Google-Chrome is started with the same
environment variable, such that it can detect the Silverlight plugin. All other
browsers will not have Silverlight enabled, because they don't search for
plugins in the custom plugin directory.
